## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Javacsript
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first project where I incorporated a substantial amount of javascript. It hepled me better understand how functions work and are invoked and how cthe flow of the code executes.

for example:
```
function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    success = 0;
    validateName();
    validateNumber();
    validateDate();
    validateCvc();

    if(success == 4) {
        form.style.display = "none";
        completeContainer.style.display = "block";
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I look forward to further developing my understanding of javascript by incorporating other more advanced features of the language, such as objects.
